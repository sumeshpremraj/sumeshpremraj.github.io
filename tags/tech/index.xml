Hardware My work machine is a Macbook Pro 2019, and I have mixed feelings about it - love its sleek design, hate the mess of connectors. I have a dual 24&amp;quot; monitor setup at work, and a single 24&amp;quot; screen at home. My work is a mix of development and operations, so most of my time is spent within a code editor, a terminal, browser, and a music player.</description></item></channel></rss>
