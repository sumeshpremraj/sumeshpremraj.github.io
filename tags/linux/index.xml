One of the screens would refuse to run at its maximum resolution.
It took me a while, but adding the resolution manually with xrandr and playing around with X configuration files fixed the issue.
Adding new resolution with xrandr Run xrandrto identify the screens by name. Note these names, they&amp;rsquo;ll be used in X conf files and for xrandr commands later.</description></item><item><title>Installing Arch Linux from scratch</title><link>https://sumesh.work/blog/installing-arch-linux-from-scratch/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sumesh.work/blog/installing-arch-linux-from-scratch/</guid><description>This is a dump of commands I used, for future reference.
