This might help if you use a cloud provider from Amazon, Google GCP or similar, and want to do the same.
Jenkins has a great plugin ecosystem, and we can use the Groovy Label Assignment plugin to make Jenkins pick the local slave automatically.</description></item><item><title>Migrating to a new VPS - notes and command reference</title><link>https://sumesh.work/blog/migrating-to-a-new-vps-notes-and-command-reference/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Aug 2014 15:40:30 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://sumesh.work/blog/migrating-to-a-new-vps-notes-and-command-reference/</guid><description>I tried to setup this site on my VPS late at night. Sleepiness lead to stupidity and I ended up breaking various things on my site, that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite restore. Frustration eventually gave way, and I decided to set up a fresh VPS and finally make the move to nginx webserver. Previously, Apache2 tweaked for low memory was used, but it was still poor.
VPS migration can be fast and easy when done properly.</description></item></channel></rss>
