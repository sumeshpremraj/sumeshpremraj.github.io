I'm **Sumesh Premraj**.

I'm a tinkerer at heart, and I love building reliable large scale systems. 

I am currently working as an SRE on data streaming and ingestion infrastructure for a tech company.

Previously, I worked as an SRE in LinkedIn and Microsoft.

With my colleages at LinkedIn, I co-authored the [School of SRE](http://linkedin.github.io/school-of-sre), an open-source curriculum for aspiring site reliability engineers.
