Hello, I'm **Sumesh Premraj**.

I'm a tinkerer at heart, with interest in large scale web infrastructure.

Previously, I worked as an SRE in LinkedIn, Microsoft and a few startups.

With my colleages at LinkedIn, I co-authored the [School of SRE](http://linkedin.github.io/school-of-sre), an open-source curriculum for aspiring site reliability engineers.
