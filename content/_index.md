I'm **Sumesh Premraj**.

I'm a tinkerer at heart, and I love building reliable large scale systems. 

I have been working on LinkedIn's Site Reliability Engineering team for the past 2 years.

With my colleages at LinkedIn, I co-authored the [School of SRE](http://linkedin.github.io/school-of-sre), an open-source curriculum for aspiring site reliability engineers.
