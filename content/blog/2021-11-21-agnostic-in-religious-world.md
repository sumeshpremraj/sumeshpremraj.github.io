I was born into a highly religious family in India. My ancestral home even has a small temple within our own land, that has been worshipped for as long as anyone can remember.

Like most other Indians, I grew up hearing tales from religious mythology, visiting temples and *pujas* (religious rituals). 

But my father and maternal grandfather always encouraged me to think for myself, and so I did.

God never made much sense to me even as a child. The more I thought about it, the more paradoxical everything about religion and God looked to me.

Why are we praying to an invisible God?

**If God really exists, why do some really selfless and honest people suffer ceaselessly?**

If there is an invisible force controlling everything, they are not really doing a great job.

These feelings intensified after seeing someone dear to me suffer and not even have the luxury of dying to end their misery - someone who never hurt or manipulated anyone in their entire life, lived out their life peacefully and took care of family.

But maybe I am missing something. Maybe suffering is part of existence and life itself, and God as an entity is not the saviour for everyone as we think.

> agnostic (*noun*): a person who believes that nothing is known or can be known of the existence or nature of God.

The human species is constantly learning, and whenever we look back in history, many of the beliefs we held turn out to be wrong.

So, I am agnostic.
